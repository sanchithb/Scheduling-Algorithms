# Proccess Scheduling Algorrithms

### We have come across the theorytical concept of proccess scheduling algorithms. This repo is the **C** version of it. It gives an output of *Average Wait Time* and *Average Turn Around Time*.

The scheduling proccess written are
* **FCFS** : **F**irst **C**ome **F**irst **S**erve Scheduling
* **PRIORITY** Scheduling
* **RR** : **R**ound **R**obin Scheduling
* **SJF** : **S**hortest **J**ob **F**irst Scheduling
* **SRTF** : **S**hortest **R**un **T**ime **F**irst Scheduling

##Enjoy!
